The extension requires the following icon files in this directory:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Please generate these icons using a graphics editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or an online icon generator tool.

The icons should be PNG format with a transparent background.

For development purposes, you can use any placeholder icon, but for production, 
you should create custom icons that represent your extension's functionality.
